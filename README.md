- RPG style leveling: Strength, intelligence, endurance, and luck will bolster your stats in combat.
- Hero Mode: Challenge yourself in this mode where damage is tripled and drained heart containers can no longer be recovered. Ever. Try not to lose them all.
- Shield Durability: Consider dodging. Shields can be re-bought at a shop.
- Perfect Block: Don't want to lose stamina? Don't want to lose durability? Don't want to take damage? Now you can have it all.

- Double Damage: Those Deku Babas aren't playing anymore.
- Potions: Drinking a potion no longer pauses the game.
